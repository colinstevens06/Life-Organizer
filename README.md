# Life-Organizer

Created this app so that users can save notes to reference in the future.

## How It Works

I used a JabaScript languages to write this app. I used:
* ReactJS for the front end
* SASS for my styling
* MongoDB and Mongoose for my database
* ExpressJS for my server
* NodeJS as my package manager
